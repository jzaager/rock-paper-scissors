# The Odin Project - Foundations Path

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

A classic game brought to life in the browser with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Currently live at [Live Version](https://jzaager.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

### Part 1 - Please Console Me

This game was originally made solely in the browser console using only 
JavaScript. The game started by prompting the user for an input and only began 
if "rock", "paper", or "scissors", case insensitive, was input. 

**Part 1 helped with:**
* Furthering my understanding of the browser console
* Basic JavaScript and practicing functions

### Part 2 - Facing the Interface

After learning about DOM manipulation and event handlers, this project was 
revisited to add a UI. There are no media queries as of yet, so the game 
remains desktop based.

**Part 2 helped with:**
* Refreshing CSS
* Event handlers & DOM Manipulation - appending output to the page based on button clicks
* Further understanding of JavaScript functions
